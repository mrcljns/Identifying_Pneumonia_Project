# Identifying Pneumonia in chest X-ray images
Final project created for the "Machine Learning 2: predictive models, deep learning, neural network" course at the University of Warsaw. The objective was to use stacking for creating an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can provide superior identification of penumonia on an X-ray image of a chest.
